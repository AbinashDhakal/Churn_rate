# Analysing Customer Churn in Power BI
In this repository, we delve into a comprehensive case study using Power BI to analyze customer churn rates for a fictitious telecom company named Databel. The project aims to gain insights into the reasons behind customer attrition and propose strategies to mitigate churn.

## Dataset Overview
The repository utilizes a synthetic churn dataset from Databel, containing 29 columns representing various customer attributes. Each row corresponds to an individual customer.

## Churn Rate and its Significance
Churn Rate, synonymous with customer attrition, quantifies the rate at which customers cease their engagement with a business entity. Minimizing churn holds a crucial position in corporate strategy, as retaining existing customers often proves more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The straightforward formula for churn is the ratio of customers lost to the total customer count. Notably, churn calculation methods differ based on industry and revenue models. For instance, an e-commerce platform might define churn as customers who have remained inactive for the last 12 months.

## Insights from Analysis
After conducting a thorough analysis, the following key insights were derived from the churn dataset:

## General Insights
Databel's overall churn rate is approximately 27%.
45% of churn instances are attributed to competitive factors.
Remarkably high churn rate (>60%) observed in the state of California (CA).
Churn Rate by Age
Senior citizens exhibit a churn rate 10% higher than the average (38.22%).
Age-based analysis unveils an escalating trend in churn rate across different age brackets.
Churn Rate by Contract
Group contracts, offering discounted rates for households, experience the lowest churn rate at 23% (for groups of 6 customers).
Monthly contracts demonstrate higher churn compared to annual contracts.
Churn Rate by Data Plan
Contrary to expectations, customers on unlimited data plans are prone to higher churn.
Segmentation by average monthly data usage reveals the highest churn among customers with unlimited plans and data usage below 5GB.
Churn Rate by International Activity
In-depth analysis of international activity exposes a high churn rate in California (CA).
In CA, 72% of churners make international calls without having an international plan.
Churn Rate by Customer Service
Customer service interaction frequency correlates with elevated churn rates, particularly for monthly contract customers paying by direct debit.
Average of 1.47 customer service calls per customer translates to a churn rate of around 54% for this segment.
Proposed Business Strategies
Based on the insights gathered, several potential strategies are recommended to address churn and enhance customer retention for Databel:

## Targeted International Plan Offers: Reach out to customers without international plans who exhibit potential interest in international calling. Propose downgrading to a cost-effective plan with an explanation, anticipating improved customer satisfaction and reduced churn.

## Payment Method Investigation: Given the correlation between direct debit payments and high churn, conduct an in-depth analysis of payment processing. This investigation could uncover underlying payment issues that might be contributing to customer attrition.

## Conclusion
This repository presents a comprehensive Power BI case study analyzing customer churn rates for Databel Telecom. The insights gained provide valuable direction for devising strategies aimed at enhancing customer retention and addressing the underlying causes of churn. By leveraging data-driven decision-making, Databel can strengthen its customer base and foster long-term growth.
